# Temperature-monitoring-using-IOT-and-Cloud
Python program will fetch the temperature data collected by Bolt and send SMS if the temperature value goes outside our specified temperature range. I have used Twilio for sms functionality for getting updates. Twilio is a third-party SMS functionality provider. It is a cloud communications platform as a service (PaaS) company. Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and also send and receive text messages using its web service APIs.
